fwordle: Wordle, but with friends!

This game is meant to be a fun developer experiment. It implements the various Wordle features of checking guess closeness, 
while providing a synchronized game experiences so friends can solve puzzles together. 

So far, the following has been implemented:
* multiple players can connect to the same Wordle session, and try to solve the same puzzle
* each players' keystrokes are credited, so you can blame your friends for bad guesses

Some expected future features include:
* one player can be the word picker, to try and befuddle their friends
* configurable game parameters (length, categories, etc.)
